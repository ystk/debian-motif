motif (2.3.4-1)

  * The Xprint library has been deprecated in Debian for some time now (see
    #657253), so the low-level print support of Motif has not worked for that
    time. Upsteam Motif now has a configure option to not build the printing
    support, but doing so removes symbols that would otherwise be present. As
    we are now moving Motif to the main archive, packages now depending on
    lesstif2 in Debian don't depend on the printing functionality and need to
    be rebuild agains motif, and the motif libraries are split into different
    packages anyway, we have decided to just configure Motif without xprint
    support without bumping the soname (upstream should have done that
    properly).

  * The Motif Demos (or SDK Examples) are not built and distributed in any
    of the motif binary packages in Debian.
    They are available in the motif source package, and can be built, after
    removing the line: ' --disable-demos \' from debian/rules, like any
    other source package [1].
