                     Integrated Computer Solutions


This document provides Release Notes for the release of Motif 2.3.4.

This contains information on what is new in Motif 2.3.4. 
Please see the COPYING file included with this release.


Introduction

This document and accompanying text files contain important information. 
Please read them carefully before starting the build and
installation procedures.

There are two ways to build Motif from source code: Imake and AutoTools.

If you are using Imake, please read INSTALL.imake for notes on how to build
and install this product using Imake. This method is deprecated due to
a lack of support. Users wishing to apply/test and patch the Imake system
should join the development mailing list; all contributions are welcome.

Please see the file INSTALL.configure on how to build and install this product
using the autoconf tools. This method is now fully supported and 
is the recommended build method.


1. What is Motif 2.3.4

Motif is a freely available source code distribution for the 
Motif user interface component toolkit. Motif is built on top of the 
standard X Toolkit(Xt) and X11 libraries.

1.1. Overview of Motif

   was mentioned in configure.in. The proper source code was placed

   reference was removed.
